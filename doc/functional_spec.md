# Functional Specification


## Purpose

The **goal of PDB autofill is to classify the reason for missing densities** in crystallographic data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). If time permits, the stretch goal is to then predict the x-y-z positions of missing densities found in PDB files.


## Example Use Cases

Josie is a computational scientist who will be using the tool to determine the expected structure of her proteins of interest. She is very comfortable using python packages to analyze her data.

* Josie will use this software to classify the reason her proteins of interest have missing densities in the PDB.
* Josie will use this software to predict the missing densities in her proteins of interest.
* Josie may also be interested in using the software to extract amino acid sequences in a CSV format to perform further analysis on her own.


Joe is an experimentalist who will be using the tool to determine whether he expects to find missing densities in the protein for which he will be collecting X-Ray crystallographic data. He has limited programming experience, but is an expert user of tools like Excel and instrumentation control software.

* Joe will use this software to determine whether he should expect missing densities in his experiment.
* Joes will use this software to classify why some experiments will result in missing densities.
* Joes will use this software to predict the missing densities that are not visible in the experiment.
